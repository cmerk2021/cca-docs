# Network Privacy Notice

## The Basics

Not all privacy risks apply to all users and deployments. Some users, such as those accessing web apps only, experience minimal privacy risks.

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>If you received equipment to use as your internet gateway (“default route”), your internet connections pass through “Covered Infrastructure/CPE” managed by CCA.</li>
  <li>As with any third party managed solution, you need to be aware of the privacy risks and how they are handled.</li>
  <li>No networking solution can guarantee absolute security or privacy.</li>
</ul>


## Important Disclosures

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>The networking environment you use contains components that are considered research/experimental/training/beta environments and may have routine and exigent third party access grants.</li>
  <li>In general, it is impossible to guarantee absolute privacy or security.</li>
  <li>All networks, including this one, are subject to unauthorized access and data compromise (so-called “hacking”).</li>
</ul>

## Covered Infrastructure/CPE

Your connection to the internet and other resources may include the use of:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Firewall/routers</li>
  <li>Access and core switches</li>
  <li>Wireless access points</li>
  <li>Bridges/modems</li>
  <li>Diagnostic and monitoring equipment/software</li>
  <li>Servers/software</li>
  <li>Cameras/environmental sensors/access control/alarms</li>
</ul>

## Potential Privacy Risks

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>During the normal operation of the network certain logs about your activity may be stored and maintained.</li>
  <li>Third parties may be able to access logs.</li>
  <li>An improperly configured network may result in unauthorized access to certain control-related data and systems.</li>
  <li>As Generative AI is implemented into network technologies, it is impossible to fully know how this network’s data will be used to train the model.</li>
</ul>

## Example Potential Risks

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>The domain names of the websites you access are stored and viewable by others.</li>
  <li>The names of applications you access are highlighted in a “large bandwidth utilization” report viewable by others.</li>
  <li>Software designed to analyze logs can determine when you are home based upon your network traffic.</li>
  <li>All infrastructure is subject to compromise and unauthorized data access – no system, including this one, is fully 100% secure or private.</li>
</ul>

## Sensitive Location Information

In general, your real-time and/or historical location is considered sensitive and special risks are associated with this data. These risks are caused by:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Cameras/environmental sensors/access control/alarms that can determine your location. <br> <i>For example, a camera outside can see when you enter/leave your home and interior environmental/alarm sensors can tell how long you spend in each room.</i>
 </li>
</ul>

## Privacy Effects

Information about your network activity may be stored and accessed.

When you access hosted applications that are a part of the infrastructure, information is logged about your session and device, including future sessions that use the same or subsequent session tokens. 

**There is a lesser expectation of privacy when accessing hosted applications or resources.**

## How your privacy is protected

Reasonable measures are taken to protect your privacy, including:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Requiring strong, phishing resistant multifactor authentication</li>
  <li>Strong technical and risk management qualification required to hold “Public Trust Status” to view and modify other users’ data</li>
  <li>Comprehensive logging to aid in the identification and remediation of data compromise situations</li>
  <li>Third parties with access are expected to act in good faith</li>
  <li>Network technologies solely designed to identify specific user behaviors are not implemented</li>
</ul>
